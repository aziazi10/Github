                    <b>T</b>he desire be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep
                    within everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly
                    respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest
                    amond of ottention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the
                    best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.

                    I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect
                    is showing someone extra special attantion, or high regard, based on a desire to show them
                    how highly they are valued.
